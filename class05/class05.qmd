## Background

There are lots of ways to make figures in R. These include so-called "base R" graphics (e.g. `plot()`) and tons of add-on packages like **ggplot2**.

For example, here we make the same plot with both:

```{r}
head(cars)
```

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
First I need to install the package with the command 
`install.packages()`.

> **N.B.** We never run an install cmd in a quarto code chunk or we will end up re-installing packages many many times - which is not what we want!

Every time we want to use one of these "add-on" packages we need to load it up in R with the `library()` function:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(cars)
```

Every ggplot needs at lesst 3 things:

- The **data**, the stuff you want plotted
- The **aesthetics**, how the data map to the plot
- The **geometry**, the type of plot

```{r}
ggplot(cars) +
  aes(x=speed, y=dist) +
  geom_point()
```

Add a line to better show relationship between speed and distance

```{r}
p <- ggplot(cars) +
  aes(x=speed, y=dist) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) +
  labs(title="Stopping Distance of Old Cars",
       subtitle = "Data from the `cars` object",
       x = "Speed (mph)",
       y = "Distance (ft)")
```

```{r}
p
```


```{r}
p + theme_bw()
```

## Gene Expression Plot

We can read the input data from the class website.

```{r}
url <- "https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_S20/class-material/up_down_expression.txt"
genes <- read.delim(url)
head(genes)
```

A first version plot

```{r}
ggplot(genes) + 
  aes(Condition1, Condition2) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
table(genes$State)
```

Version 2 let's color by `State` so we can see the "up" and "down" significant genes compared to all the unchanged genese.

```{r}
ggplot(genes) + 
  aes(Condition1, Condition2, col=State) +
  geom_point()
```
Version 3 plot, let's modify the default colors to something we like. 

```{r}
ggplot(genes) + 
  aes(Condition1, Condition2, col=State) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("purple",
                               "grey",
                               "pink")) +
  labs(x="Control (no drug)",
       y = "Drug",
       title = "Gene Expression Changes upon GLP-1 Drug") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Going Further

Let's have a look at the famous **Gapminder** 

```{r}
# File location online
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/gapminder/master/inst/extdata/gapminder.tsv"

gapminder <- read.delim(url)
```

```{r}
head(gapminder, 3)
```

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, col=continent) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)
```

Let's "facet" (i.e. make a seperate plot) by contient rather than the big hot mess above.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, col=continent) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```

## Custom Plots

How big is this gapminder dataset?

```{r}
nrow(gapminder)
```

I want to "filter" down to a subset of this data. I will use the **dplyr** package to help me.

First I need to install it and then load it up...
`install.packages("dplyr")` and then `library(dplyr)`

```{r}
library(dplyr)

gapminder_2007 <- filter(gapminder, year==2007)
head(gapminder_2007)
```

```{r}
filter(gapminder_2007, country == "Ireland")
```

```{r}
filter(gapminder, year==2007, country=="Ireland")
```

```{r}
filter(gapminder, year==2007, country=="United States")
```

Q. Make a plot comparing 1977 and 2007 for all countries.

```{r}
gapminder_1977 <- filter(gapminder, year %in% c(1977,2007))

ggplot(gapminder_1977) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent,
                 size = pop), alpha=0.7) + 
  scale_size_area(max_size = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~year)
```
